HardView
Scott Lowrey sdlowrey@gmail.com

HardView is a Linux tool that shows you the hardware components that
make up a computer system.  You can see the system from one or more
perspectives including bus type, function, and subsystem.

The intent is to bring several Linux tools together into one place and
provide various ways to view and format the collective information.

For help with command line use, see 'hardview --help'.  

To see command line options, invoke 'man hardview'.
